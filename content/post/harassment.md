MIDDLEWARE is an ACM event and every edition of MIDDLEWARE strictly abides by the [ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment)

Any individual who experiences or witnesses harassment (as described above) at MIDDLEWARE or any ACM activity should follow the [ACM Procedures for Reporting Unacceptable Behavior](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/reporting-unacceptable-behavior).

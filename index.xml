      <description>Test of Time Award The Test of Time Award, started in 2009, is given every year to a paper published in MIDDLEWARE 10 years prior, which has had the most impact since publication (in terms of seeding new research directions, influencing other research and/or resulting in widely used software systems). Candidates for the Test of Time Award are shortlisted and evaluated by a committee appointed by the Middleware Steering Committee. The awardees are invited to give a retrospective keynote talk at the conference.</description>

The Middleware conference plans at least two years ahead and is accepting expressions of interest (EOI) and proposals to host future conferences at any time. An EOI is put forward informally by email to the Chair of the Steering Committee of the Middleware Conference.

Our primary concern is that members of our community, and their families and friends, remain safe and healthy. We are aware of the challenges people in different regions of the world are facing, and consequently MIDDLEWARE 2020 was a virtual conference.</description>

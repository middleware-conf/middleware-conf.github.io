      <description>The MIDDLEWARE Steering and Organizing Committees have been actively discussing how the situation surrounding COVID-19 has been evolving around the world.
We deeply sympathize with those who have been affected in various ways by COVID-19. Our primary concern is that members of our community, and their families and friends, remain safe and healthy. We are aware of the challenges people in different regions of the world are facing, and consequently MIDDLEWARE 2020 was a virtual conference.</description>

      <description>The Middleware conference plans at least two years ahead and is accepting expressions of interest (EOI) and proposals to host future conferences at any time. An EOI is put forward informally by email to the Chair of the Steering Committee of the Middleware Conference. The Steering Committee will then be in touch with the applicants to work towards the submission of a conference hosting proposal for a targeted year. The Steering Committee reserves the right to discourage applicants to go forward with a proposal.</description>

Candidates for the Test of Time Award are shortlisted and evaluated by a committee appointed by the Middleware Steering Committee. The awardees are invited to give a retrospective keynote talk at the conference.</description>

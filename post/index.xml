      <description>The MIDDLEWARE Steering and Organizing Committees have been actively discussing how the situation surrounding COVID-19 has been evolving around the world.
We deeply sympathize with those who have been affected in various ways by COVID-19. Our primary concern is that members of our community, and their families and friends, remain safe and healthy. We are aware of the challenges people in different regions of the world are facing, and consequently MIDDLEWARE 2020 was a virtual conference.</description>
